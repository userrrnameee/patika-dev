  <h2><i>How Long To Cook Cupcakes For : </i> </h2>
  <p>
    The cupcakes should only take 20 minutes to cook – resist the urge to open the oven door and check on them until the time is up, just peek through the oven door if you have a glass one!
    <br> <br>
    Take the cakes out of the oven – you will know that they are ready if they have risen up and spring back into shape when you press gently down on them. They will also be a golden shade.
<br> <br>
    If you are unsure, grab a cocktail stick or kebab stick, and poke it through the middle of one, if it comes out dry, the cakes are done. If the cocktail stick is wet, put the cupcakes back in the oven for a little while longer.</p>

<h2><b>Making Other Flavours Of Cupcakes</b></h2>
<p>Cupcakes are a versatile recipe, you can add in other ingredients and completely change the flavour. There are many options, lemon, chocolate or carrot are popular cupcake choices!
